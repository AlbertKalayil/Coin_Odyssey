# Coin Odyssey - Space Limited theme

Game Mechanics:
- small square that moves around screen and collects coins - coins and blocks randomly spawn
- max coins wins
- coins spawn some places
- WASD controls

## Inspiration 
We were fascinated by the old Atari games and wanted to give this game that sort of look using Pygame to honour those games. 

## What it does
The theme was limited space, so we decided that the way were going to implement it was by introducing new barriers every time a coin was collected - hence the name Coin Odyssey. The goal of the game is to get the highest score despite the increasing limited space and decreasing time.

## How we built it
We built it using the Pygame framework in Python and we uses classes and methods to provide attributes to the coins and blocks that spawned. We implemented pygame by using the rect method to make our objects into squares that could have bounding boxes. We collaborated using Github.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few challenges while making our project. We needed a place to collaborate so we decided to use GitHub. Although we were a bit unfamiliar with git and ran into some problems along the way, we were able to collaborate and produce a wonderful final project. 

We also ran into challenges where the coins would spawn within the barrier boxes so we removed that issue by using the pygame.rect.colliderect() method.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Getting a time limit and score board to work
- Learning more about git
- Getting the coins to respawn, and the boxes to continue spawning without them ever overlapping

## What we learned
We learned the process about creating a game; for instance, we learned more about refresh rates, how a computer calculates time, and how we could implement different Pygame methods within the objects that we created.

## What's next for Coin Odyssey
We would certainly like to refine the interface. Our goal after this project is to have it so that an illuminated area would follow the player as they moved. This would give the feel of limited space for the user without physically limiting the space. In the future, we would also like to implement images and animations in our project.
